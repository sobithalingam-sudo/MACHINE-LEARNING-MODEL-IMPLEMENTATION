##In this task, a predictive model was created using Python and the Scikit-learn library. A dataset was used to train the machine learning model to classify or predict outcomes, such as identifying spam emails. The data was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance. This task demonstrates the basic implementation of machine learning concepts. The final deliverable includes a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the model’s implementation and evaluation.
